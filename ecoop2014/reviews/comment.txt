   Paper #25: Precise Data Flow Analysis in the Presence of Correlated
              Method Calls
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of the PC discussion:

Pros:
+ The paper addresses an interesting problem in program analysis, which can potentially achieve more precise analysis results.
+ The presentation is good. Motivating example and the theory fit nicely.

Cons:
- The paper presents no results on efficiency or precision, even though the authors claim the algorithm is implemented.
- Without experimental results, the usefulness of the algorithm cannot be determined. Neither runtime data nor space requirements for the analysis is provided.
- The coverage of the related work may be extended (e.g. comparison with object-sensitivity).

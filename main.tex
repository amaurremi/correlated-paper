\begin{abstract}
We present a technique to improve the precision of data-flow analyses on object-oriented programs in the presence of 	\textit{correlated calls}. Two method calls are correlated if they are polymorphic and are invoked on the same object. Correlated calls are problematic because they can make  existing data-flow analyses consider certain infeasible data-flow paths as valid. This leads to loss in precision of the analysis solution.

We show how infeasible paths can be eliminated for \textit{Inter-procedural Finite Distributive Subset} (IFDS) problems, a large class of data-flow analysis problems. We show how the precision of IFDS problems can be improved in the presence of correlated calls, by using the \textit{Inter-procedural Distributive Environment} (IDE) algorithm to eliminate infeasible paths.  Using IDE, we eliminate the infeasible paths and obtain a more precise result for the original IFDS problem.

Our analysis is implemented in Scala, using the WALA framework for static program analysis on Java bytecode.
